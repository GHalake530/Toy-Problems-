# Toy-Problems-
In this project we were asked to solve for 3 different problems.
Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)

Write a function that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. The output should correspond the correct grade, as shown below: 

        A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.


 

Challenge 2: Speed Detector (Toy Problem)

Write a program that takes the speed of a car as input e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

   > For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.

For this in the js file called speed.js. I was able to provide a solution for the above challenge, whereby the user inputs in the speed of the driver and issues the required response. i.e if speed is less that 70, its okay, if speed is above 70, demerit points are given untill when it gets to 12 points and the license is suspended.
 

Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator (Toy Problem)

Write a program whose major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIF Deductions, NSSF Deductions, gross salary, and net salary. 

NB: Use KRA, NHIF, and NSSF values provided in the link below.

Solution
For this, in the js file called grade.js i was able to create a js code that prompts the marks of the student and gives out their result with regards to the above grading system.

Solution
For this in the js file called speed.js. I was able to provide a solution for the above challenge, whereby the user inputs in the speed of the driver and issues the required response. i.e if speed is less that 70, its okay, if speed is above 70, demerit points are given untill when it gets to 12 points and the license is suspended.

Solution
For this, in the js folder speed.js, i was able to write a code that would calculate the net salary of an individual and calculate the amount of deductions they receive. It also calculates the amount of money paid to each specific deductable i.e PAYE, nssf, nhif etc
